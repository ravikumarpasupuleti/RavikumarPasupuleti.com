## Setting up Gatsby Development using Visual Studio Codespaces

Recently, I have set up my personal blog site using Gatsby and Netlify.

In this article, I will explain how you can set up development environment in no time using Visual Stuido Code spaces.

## Visual Studio Codespaces

Visual Studio Codespaces provides cloud-hosted development environments for any activity. You can create a new Codespace through Visual Studio Codespaces or by signing up for the GitHub beta. You can connect to Codespaces from Visual Studio Code.

I have created 2 Visual Studio Codespaces, one for my SharePoint Development and other for React Development.
