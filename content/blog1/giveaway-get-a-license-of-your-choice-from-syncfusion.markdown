Often we run up into the need for third party controls to give your apps/sites that extra edge that all of us are looking for. Syncfusion provides an excellent collection of controls for various platforms, details of which you can find [here](http://www.syncfusion.com/products?UTM_medium=rahulblogreview) .
Syncfusion was generous enough to giveaway a license for the readers of this blog. I didn't want to restrict you to get a license for a platform of my choice, so its all yours. You get to choose which platform license you want out of the the 9 different option(ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, Mobile MVC, Silverlight, WinForms, Windows Phone, WinRT and WPF) on the site. So who would be that lucky one?

## **How to be that lucky one?**

Check out the form below on how.

Once the winner is decided you would be notified via email. Choosing the lucky one would be this blog admins responsibility. Any decision made by the admin would be final.

Hope you are that lucky one !

** Edit: **Had a very good response and am really happy to announce the winners. Instead of 1 lucky winner I am planning to make it 3. The lucky 3 would be soon contacted with more details
