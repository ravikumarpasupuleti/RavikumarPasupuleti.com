Thanks to everyone who attended our([Gautam](https://twitter.com/techgd) and mine) talk on Getting Started with Windows Phone and Store application on June 18, Tuesday as part of the Readiness training at Microsoft. Special thanks to [Vamsi](https://twitter.com/vamsitp) for assisting us throughout. I hope you all enjoyed the session as much as we did. Here are some follow up information that might help you on the way forward. Since the intended audience are from testing and UX the follow up material is more aligned towards that.
