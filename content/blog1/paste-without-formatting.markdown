I share a lot of information copying and pasting from websites. Most of the times I want to share just the text and not any formatting. To remove any text formatting, I copy it into Notepad and then onto the destination. Yesterday I found that using **Ctrl + Shift + V** to paste (instead of _Ctrl + V_) removes all text formatting.

As shown, when using Ctrl + V the text gets copied along with the formatting as shown below.

<img alt="Paste With Formatting" src="../images/paste_with_formatting.png" />

When using Ctrl + Shift + V, only the text gets copied and the formatting is ignored.
<img alt="Paste Without Formatting" src="../images/paste_without_formatting.png" />

Using this shortcut saves time as I no longer need to open Notepad for this!

PS: As one of my readers rightly pointed out (below in the comments), this might not work on all applications. I have tried this on Chrome Browser and Lync For Business and worked fine.
