I prefer to use the keyboard to navigate within sites I use frequently. Keyboard enables to navigate faster within site and perform tasks quicker. The [Logitech MX Master](http://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/review-six-months-and-counting-logitech-mx-master/) mouse provides a lot of capabilities to navigate. But I find the keyboard faster to perform repetitive actions - like posting a new status update on social media sites, managing tasks in Jira, TFS online, GitHub, responding to emails, Todoist, etc. Finding keyboard shortcuts on these various sites can itself be a daunting task. One might need to google to get the shortcuts or find the relevant documentation on the site. Luckily most of the popular sites today display a pop-up modal with all the keyboard shortcuts for the site when pressing **Shift + ?**. Note that this might not work on all the sites out there. But for most of the common ones that I use l, I find it working.

So the next time you spend a lot of time on a website try hitting **Shift + ?** to look for supported keyboard shortcuts.
