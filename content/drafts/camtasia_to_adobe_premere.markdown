I am using Adobe Premiere now for editing and the overll editing experience has become so much better. In this post let's look at why I moved away from Camtasia 2020 to Adobe Premiere and how I edit currently in Premiere. It tries to match up the tools that I used in Camtasia to that in Adobe Premiere. It is easy to get lost in Premiere for the vastness of features so this might help some one making the move like me.
