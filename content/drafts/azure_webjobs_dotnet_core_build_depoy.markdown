WebJobs is a feature of Azure App Service that enables you to run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app. Sicne this runs as part of the same instance as the Web App, there is no additional cost to use WebJobs. _WebJobs is not supported on a Linux App Service._

The Azure WebJobs SDK simplifies the task of writing WebJobs. Version 3.x of WebJobs SDK supports both .NET Core and .NET Framework.

A WebJob is created as a Console Application.
